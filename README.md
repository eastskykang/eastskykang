Hi, I am a doctoral student in computer science at ETH Zurich and a research assistant at the [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/). 
The main goal of my research is to develop legged robots that move like real animals, by combining principles from optimal control, reinforcement learning, and data-driven character animation techniques.

Other than my professional bio, I am from Seoul, South Korea :kr: and now live in Zurich, Switzerland :switzerland:. 

As I describe myself, I am an open source enthusiast, an indie game fan, a caffeine addcited and classical music lover. In my free time, I hike beautiful mountains in Switzerland, go to orchestral concerts and watch lovely Ghibli and Disney animations. :D
