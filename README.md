Hi, I am a doctoral student at ETH Zurich and a research assistant at [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/). I am currently doing my research on the legged robots locomotion and design optimization. 

My research interests are threefolds
1. optimization- or machine-learning-based control of robot locomotion 
2. simulation methods for robotics applications
3. design optimization of legged robot for graceful motion

Other than my professional bio, I am from Seoul, South Korea :kr: and now live in Zurich, Switzerland :switzerland:. 

As I describe myself, I am an open source enthusiast, an indie game fan, a caffeine addcited and classical music lover. In my free time, I hike beautiful mountains in Switzerland, go to orchestral concerts and watch lovely Ghibli and Disney animations. :D
