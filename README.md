Hi, I am a doctoral student at ETH Zurich and research assistant at [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of Prof. Stelian Coros. I am currently doing my research on the legged robots locomotion and design optimization. 

My research interests are threefolds
1. optimization- or machine-learning-based control of robot locomotion 
2. simulation methods for robotics application
3. design optimization of legged robot for graceful motion  

Please visit my website for my more detailed CV: [donghok.me](www.donghok.me)

Other than my professional bio, I am an open source enthusiast, an indie game lover and a coffee lover (especially coffee with citrus flavours!). I love listening to classical music (Specifically I listen to Mahler, Bruckner, Brahms and Beethoven), Radiohead, Sigur Ros, hiking beautiful mountains in Switzerland, and watching lovely Ghibli and Disney animations :D
